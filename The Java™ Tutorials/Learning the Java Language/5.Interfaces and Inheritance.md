<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="subclasses.html">Inheritance</a></h2>
<p>This section describes the way in which you can derive one class from another. That is, how a <i>subclass</i> can inherit fields and methods from a <i>superclass</i>. You will learn that all classes are derived from the <code>Object</code> class, and how to modify the methods that a subclass inherits from superclasses. This section also covers interface-like <i>abstract classes</i>.</p>
