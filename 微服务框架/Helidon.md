## Introduction

Helidon is a collection of Java libraries for writing microservices. There is no unique tooling or deployment model. Your microservice is just a Java SE application.

The foundation of Helidon is composed of three components:

- WebServer

A programmatic HTTP API with reactive features, powered by Netty.

- Config

A flexible configuration framework with support for multiple sources and formats.

- Security

A tool-chain to handle authentication, authorization and context propagation.
